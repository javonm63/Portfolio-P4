💼 My Project — BizAI

Description:
BizAI is an HTTPS API service that uses AI to automate user navigation and experience for online business websites and stores.
It provides configurable APIs such as:

🤖 AI Chatbot

🧠 AI Helpbot

🛍️ AI Product Finder

🕒 AI Opening Hours
…and more — all powered by OpenAI.

Each API is designed to adapt to different business structures, with simple endpoints and response formats for easy integration.
BizAI runs on its own secure server and database, ensuring safe management of bot configurations and user data.

Solve the problem of complex navigation and vague information on business websites.
